Solution: Westpac Forest<br/>

Taking inspiration from the mobile forest application, we have developed a solution called Westpac Forest. Our solution aims to assist people who have the financial capacity to have savings, but may struggle in different areas to save, whether it’d be their spending habits or lack of accountability. First, the user sets goals for what specifically they want to save for, to be mindful of what they are working towards. (originally, we wanted to add a chatbot to assist users to help with setting their goals, which can be integrated with the Westpac banking agent) 
For every $25 saved (or some user defined amount), users are able to get Forest Points, which can then be used to plant virtual trees. Users are able to share goals and track leaderboard progress of shared saving goals with their friends through a leaderboard. We believe this aligns with Westpac’s values of being helpful; ensuring that the customer has a great banking experience, whilst also keeping things simple. We believe this is a good idea as it encourages people to maintain healthy financial habits. <br/>
