                When a piece is "captured", that piece is taken off the board for the rest of the game.
                <br><br>
                You can capture an opponent's piece by moving one of your pieces onto that piece.
                <br><br>
                Pawns have a special way of capturing - instead of moving one square up vertically like they normally do,
                they capture pieces by moving diagonally up the board.
                <br><br>
                Capturing your opponent's pieces will weaken your opponent's army and give you greater chances of winning the game.

                The King is your most important chess piece, and you must protect it at all costs.
                If your king is under attack by one of your opponent's pieces, on your move you must make a move that protects your king from the attack.
                <br><br>
                In the example shown here, white just moved their rook and now black's king is in the line of sight of the rook,
                which means on black's next move they must find a way to remove the attack on the king.
                <br><br>
                Here black can either move the king out of the rook's line of sight, or shield the rook from the king using the knight, 
                or capture the rook using the bishop.
            </div>

            <div class="tab-textbox">
                If you put your opponent's king in check, and they can't do anything to get their
                king out of attack, then that is called "checkmate" and you win!
                <br><br>
                In this image here, suppose white just moved their queen up to the top of the board.
                <br><br>
                Black can't move their king anywhere because any square it moves to, it will still be under attack by a piece.
                <br><br>
                They also can't block the attack with any pieces. So they are checkmated and white wins.

                At the start of a chess game, each player is randomly assigned a colour (white or black).
                <br><br>
                The player with the white pieces go first, and players take turns moving one of their pieces.
                <br><br>
                You can't jump over other pieces (unless you're moving the knight), and you can't make
                a move that puts your king under attack.
                <br><br>
                The animation here shows an example of how the first few moves of a chess game could go.
